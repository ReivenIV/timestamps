## Introduction

Timestamps play a crucial role in many applications, especially those involving data analysis, event tracking, or time-sensitive operations. However, handling timestamps effectively can be challenging due to their varying formats and the need for precise calculations. This repository aims to address these challenges by providing a set of algorithms implemented in [programming language(s) used in the repository] to simplify timestamp-related tasks.

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes the following algorithms:

1. **Timestamp Parsing**: Algorithm to parse timestamps from different formats (e.g., ISO 8601, UNIX timestamp) and convert them into a consistent representation.
2. **Timestamp Manipulation**: Algorithms for manipulating timestamps by adding or subtracting time intervals (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days) and adjusting for time zones.
3. **Timestamp Comparison**: Algorithms to compare timestamps to determine their order (e.g., earlier, later, or equal) and calculate the time difference between them.
4. **Timestamp Conversion**: Algorithms for converting timestamps between different time zones or formats, such as converting between UNIX timestamps and human-readable dates.
5. **Timestamp Formatting**: Algorithms to format timestamps into desired output formats, including customizing date and time representations.



## Usage

To use the algorithms in this repository with Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ReivenIV/timestamps.git
   ```

2. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
   ```
   cd timestamps
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command will read the `package.json` file in the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

5. Choose the algorithm you want to use based on your requirements.

6. Open the algorithm file in your preferred programming environment.

7. Follow the provided instructions and function signatures to integrate the algorithm into your codebase.

8. Customize the algorithm as needed or use it as a reference to build your own timestamp-related functionality.

Please refer to the individual algorithm files for more specific usage instructions, examples, and considerations.

If you encounter any issues during the installation process or while using the algorithms, please consult the repository's documentation or the specific algorithm's file for troubleshooting guidance.

## Contributing

To create a new branch for your contribution in your repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Clone the repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ReivenIV/timestamps.git
   ```
5. Change to the repository's directory:
   ```
   cd timestamps
   ```
6. Create a new branch for your contribution. Replace `your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for your feature. For example, if you're adding an algorithm for timestamp parsing, you can use:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/timestamp-parsing
   ```
   This command creates a new branch named `feature/timestamp-parsing` and switches to it.
7. Now you can implement your changes or add your algorithm to the repository.
8. Once you've made the desired changes, you can commit them using the following commands:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add algorithm for timestamp parsing"
   ```
   Replace the commit message `"Add algorithm for timestamp parsing"` with an appropriate message describing your changes.
9. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin feature/timestamp-parsing
   ```
10. Finally, you can open a pull request on the main repository (https://github.com/ReivenIV/timestamps) to propose your changes for merging into the main branch.

Remember to replace `feature/timestamp-parsing` with the actual name of your branch and adjust the commit message accordingly.
