## Introduction

Timestamps play a crucial role in many applications, especially those involving data analysis, event tracking, or time-sensitive operations. However, handling timestamps effectively can be challenging due to their varying formats and the need for precise calculations. This repository aims to address these challenges by providing a set of algorithms implemented in [programming language(s) used in the repository] to simplify timestamp-related tasks.

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes the following algorithms:

1. **Timestamp Parsing**: Algorithm to parse timestamps from different formats (e.g., ISO 8601, UNIX timestamp) and convert them into a consistent representation.
2. **Timestamp Manipulation**: Algorithms for manipulating timestamps by adding or subtracting time intervals (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days) and adjusting for time zones.
3. **Timestamp Comparison**: Algorithms to compare timestamps to determine their order (e.g., earlier, later, or equal) and calculate the time difference between them.
4. **Timestamp Conversion**: Algorithms for converting timestamps between different time zones or formats, such as converting between UNIX timestamps and human-readable dates.
5. **Timestamp Formatting**: Algorithms to format timestamps into desired output formats, including customizing date and time representations.



## Usage

To use the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone [git@github.com:ReivenIV/timestamps.git]
   ```
2. Choose the algorithm you want to use based on your requirements.
3. Open the algorithm file in your preferred programming environment.
4. Follow the provided instructions and function signatures to integrate the algorithm into your codebase.
5. Customize the algorithm as needed or use it as a reference to build your own timestamp-related functionality.

Please refer to the individual algorithm files for more specific usage instructions, examples, and considerations.
